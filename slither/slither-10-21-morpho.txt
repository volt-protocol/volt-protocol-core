MorphoCompoundPCVDeposit.deposit() (contracts/pcv/morpho/MorphoCompoundPCVDeposit.sol#109-138) uses a dangerous strict equality:
	- amount == 0 (contracts/pcv/morpho/MorphoCompoundPCVDeposit.sol#113)
Reference: https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Detector-Documentation#dangerous-strict-equalities
Response: Strict equalities can be dangerous in the way described in the slither detector documentation. 
However, if amount is 0 in either Maple or Morpho PCV Deposit, it is better to save gas and not execute further opcodes.
There is no unsafe behavior that is possible as a result of doing this strict equality that amount is 0.

Reentrancy in MorphoCompoundPCVDeposit._withdraw(address,uint256,bool) (contracts/pcv/morpho/MorphoCompoundPCVDeposit.sol#175-203):
	External calls:
	- _recordPNL() (contracts/pcv/morpho/MorphoCompoundPCVDeposit.sol#191)
		- morpho.updateP2PIndexes(cToken) (contracts/pcv/morpho/MorphoCompoundPCVDeposit.sol#210)
	State variables written after the call(s):
	- depositedAmount -= amount (contracts/pcv/morpho/MorphoCompoundPCVDeposit.sol#195)
Reentrancy in MorphoCompoundPCVDeposit.deposit() (contracts/pcv/morpho/MorphoCompoundPCVDeposit.sol#109-138):
	External calls:
	- _recordPNL() (contracts/pcv/morpho/MorphoCompoundPCVDeposit.sol#121)
		- morpho.updateP2PIndexes(cToken) (contracts/pcv/morpho/MorphoCompoundPCVDeposit.sol#210)
	State variables written after the call(s):
	- depositedAmount += amount (contracts/pcv/morpho/MorphoCompoundPCVDeposit.sol#126)
Reference: https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Detector-Documentation#reentrancy-vulnerabilities-1
Response: Anytime that function _recordPNL is called, it is from a function with a reentrancy
lock. This means that reentrancy into this contract is not possible while a previous call has not
completed. Additionally, there is no way to make this contract in a way that conforms to CEI because
updateP2PIndexes must be called before getCurrentSupplyBalanceInOf is called.
All of these functions call _recordPNL(), however, they all have a non reentrant modifier so that they won't
allow depositedAmount to be manipulated through a reentrancy attack.

 - withdrawAll
 - accrue

MorphoCompoundPCVDeposit.deposit() (contracts/pcv/morpho/MorphoCompoundPCVDeposit.sol#109-138) ignores return value by IERC20(token).approve(address(morpho),amount) (contracts/pcv/morpho/MorphoCompoundPCVDeposit.sol#130)
Reference: https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Detector-Documentation#unused-return
Response: USDC returns true and does some validation that the addresses are incorrect.
As long as the validations succeed, the function will return true. If the validations fail,
the call will revert.
DAI returns true and has no validation checks, which means the only way the approve call can fail
is if it is out of gas.

MorphoCompoundPCVDeposit.constructor(address,address,address,address,address)._core (contracts/pcv/morpho/MorphoCompoundPCVDeposit.sol#72) shadows:
	- CoreRef._core (contracts/refs/CoreRef.sol#11) (state variable)
Reference: https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Detector-Documentation#local-variable-shadowing
Response: Author acknowledges the issue, will not fix.

MorphoCompoundPCVDeposit.constructor(address,address,address,address,address)._lens (contracts/pcv/morpho/MorphoCompoundPCVDeposit.sol#76) lacks a zero-check on :
		- lens = _lens (contracts/pcv/morpho/MorphoCompoundPCVDeposit.sol#87)
Reference: https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Detector-Documentation#missing-zero-address-validation
Response: Author acknowledges the issue, will not fix because integration tests will validate the parameter is set correctly.

MorphoCompoundPCVDeposit.emergencyAction(MorphoCompoundPCVDeposit.Call[]) (contracts/pcv/morpho/MorphoCompoundPCVDeposit.sol#274-287) has external calls inside a loop: (success,returned) = calls[i].target.call(calls[i].callData) (contracts/pcv/morpho/MorphoCompoundPCVDeposit.sol#281-283)
Reference: https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Detector-Documentation/#calls-inside-a-loop
Response: DoS attacks are not a valid vector when sender is a trusted governor and the function mutates no internal contract state.

Response: Anytime that function _recordPNL is called, it is from a function with a reentrancy

Reference: https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Detector-Documentation#reentrancy-vulnerabilities-3
Response: Reentrancy is only an issue if it allows theft of funds and updating of state incorrectly in an intermediate state.
None of the listed functions mutate any state internal to the contract. If there was a collateralization oracle in the system,
then these issues would be worth investigating further and ensuring state could not get mixed up in a way that allowed an 
attacker to manipulate the target price of Volt.

Pragma version=0.8.13 (contracts/pcv/morpho/MorphoCompoundPCVDeposit.sol#2) necessitates a version too recent to be trusted. Consider deploying with 0.6.12/0.7.6/0.8.7
solc-0.8.13 is not recommended for deployment
Reference: https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Detector-Documentation#incorrect-versions-of-solidity
Response: Author has reviewed the solidity 0.8.13 list of known bugs https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/bugs.html
and not found any high issues that would lead to incorrect functioning of the smart contracts.

Low level call in MorphoCompoundPCVDeposit.emergencyAction(MorphoCompoundPCVDeposit.Call[]) (contracts/pcv/morpho/MorphoCompoundPCVDeposit.sol#274-287):
	- (success,returned) = calls[i].target.call(calls[i].callData) (contracts/pcv/morpho/MorphoCompoundPCVDeposit.sol#281-283)
Reference: https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Detector-Documentation#low-level-calls
Response: This low level call is intentional and can be used during an emergency action if funds need to be moved
out of Maple in a way the author has not yet conceived of.
